Unit 4: Photosynthesis** <span id="4"></span> 
*Photosynthesis is the process that allows plant cells to “create”
energy for themselves, to continue to exist, and to grow.  The
activities below will focus on understanding both the overall effects
and results of photosynthesis and the individual steps that enable
photosynthesis to occur.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the process of photosynthesis and its significance.
-   List the steps of photosynthesis.
-   Determine the factors that would influence or alter various specific
    steps of photosynthesis.

    Center’s “Photosynthesis” and John Kyrk’s “Photosynthesis: Light
    Reactions and Dark Reactions”**

     Instructions: Please click through these three tutorials for a
    walk-through of the photosynthetic process.  The first tutorial
    provides a general overview; the other two provide important
    specifics about the two phases of photosynthesis: the Light
    Reactions (Photosynthesis I) and the Dark Reactions (Photosynthesis
    II).  As you work through these tutorials, think about how the steps
    are interrelated and consider the important environmental factors
    surrounding each step in the process.

     Instructions:  Please click the link for this article on the web
    page to access the PDF.  Please read the entire article and take
    notes on how and why the authors suggest that artificial alteration
    of photosynthesis might be beneficial.  Then answer the following
    questions:  
        
     1)     What methods were suggested as possible mechanisms for
    increasing photosynthetic rate?  
     2)     Can you summarize a possible experiment that could test
    whether one of the suggested methods would work to increase
    photosynthetic rate and/or crop yield?  Please indicate the controls
    and variables.
