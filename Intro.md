This lab course supplements
[BIO101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101/): “Introduction to
Molecular and Cellular Biology.”  Although we cannot virtually replicate
a true lab experience, this “lab” will allow you to become familiar with
scientific thinking and techniques and will enable you to explore of
some key principles of molecular and cellular biology. The material in
this lab supplement directly relates to the material covered in the
lecture and reading portion of the course.  While the lecture and
reading portion focuses on big-picture concepts, here we will focus more
on visual understanding, manipulation, and practical use of your
knowledge.  In each unit, you will work through tutorials related to
important scientific concepts, and then will be asked to think
creatively about how your knowledge can be put to practical or
experimental use. There are also activities devoted to learning
important techniques in scientific study, including microscope use, DNA
extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction, and DNA microarrays.  As these
are frequently used, and you will be expected to understand their use in
your future studies, take this opportunity to become familiar with the
proper equipment, procedure, and use of each technique.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this lab supplement, student will be able
to:  

-   Identify the important components of scientific experiments and
    create their own experiments.
-   Identify the molecular differences between proteins, fats, and
    carbohydrates, and explain the molecular behavior of water.
-   Describe the process of photosynthesis.
-   Describe the process of cellular respiration.
-   Identify the differences between DNA and RNA.
-   Describe the entire transcription/translation process, from gene to
    protein.
-   Explain how recombinant genomes are formed.
-   Use critical thinking to find ways that any of the above natural
    processes might be altered or manipulated.
-   Explain how to use a compound light microscope for data collection.
-   Explain how to conduct and use various experimental techniques,
    including DNA extraction, PCR, and DNA microarrays.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
    
 √    Have access to a computer.  
    
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
    
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (i.e.,

 √    Have competency in the English language.

### Course Information

**Course Designers**: Olivia V. Ambrogio and Kitty Carney  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes considerable use of
the following materials:  

-   University of Rochester: Life Sciences Learning Center
-   University of Utah: Genetic Science Learning Center 

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Please note that while some units involve readings rather than lab
exercises, these readings should not be treated lightly, as they will
provide you with in-depth information on the ways in which hypotheses
are formed and tested.  All units will have exercises for you to work on
in order to learn more about the subject area, but in addition to
exercises you will also need to complete questions in the following
units and subunits:  

-   Unit 2.2
-   Unit 3.2
-   Unit 4
-   Unit 5.3
-   Unit 6
-   Unit 7
-   Unit 8.2 

**Time Commitment:**This lab course should take you approximately **26
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should
help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.
