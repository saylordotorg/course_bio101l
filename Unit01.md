**Unit 1: Biology and Life** <span id="1"></span> 
*The lab materials for this unit will focus on the Scientific Method,
methods for creating successful scientific experiments, and ways of
understanding the experiments of others. *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Design an experiment.
-   Analyze and critique the experiments of others.
-   Identify and evaluate components of experiments.
