**Unit 5: The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit focuses on transcription and translation, or the journey from
DNA to protein.  We will begin with an overview of the process, followed
by an introduction to the “manual practice” of each of the steps. 
Related scientific techniques, including Polymerase Chain Reaction and
DNA microarrays, will also be covered.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Distinguish between transcription and translation.
-   Identify the key molecular players in transcription and translation.
-   Describe molecular techniques that interrupt, study, or make use of
    the processes of transcription and translation.

     Instructions: Please click through this tutorial to learn how DNA
    is extracted from a cell and copied (transcribed) repeatedly for use
    in scientific studies.  Extraction and PCR are techniques frequently
    used in molecular biology; practice each a few times.  Then, try to
    remember all of the steps on your own, without prompting.
