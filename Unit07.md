**Unit 7: Molecular Genetics** <span id="7"></span> 
*Much of modern biological inquiry has to do with understanding genes,
their functions, and how they work together to produce a tangible
result.  The activities below focus on experimental manipulation of
genes in the form of recombination to allow rapid study of genetic
function or to provide quick solutions for undesirable genetic
combinations in agriculture or medicine.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 2 hours to complete.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe some simple aspects of gene function and inheritance.
-   Describe techniques that manipulate genes.
-   Design experiments to examine or alter gene function.

     Instructions: This resource is optional.  If your computer supports
    Shockwave, please click through this tutorial to learn how genomes
    are artificially recombined in the lab.  Then answer the following
    questions:  
        
     1)    How would you test for a gene’s function?  
     2)    How might recombination techniques be useful for this
    purpose?
