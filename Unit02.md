**Unit 2: Basic Molecules** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this section, we will focus on understanding how the chemical
properties of water, macromolecules, and DNA play a role in their
physiological functions within organisms.  We will learn how
macromolecules can be experimentally differentiated from each other, and
discuss why this differentiation might be important.  We will also learn
about the chemical and physical structure of DNA and chromosomes.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5 hours to complete.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the properties of basic molecules.
-   Explain their importance for organisms.
-   Design experiments based on an understanding of their properties.

**2.1 Water** <span id="2.1"></span> 
-   **Web Media: John Kyrk’s “The Structure of Water” and Northland
    Community Technical College’s “A Closer Look at Water”**
    Links: John Kyrk’s [“The Structure of
    Water”](http://www.johnkyrk.com/H2O.html) (Adobe Flash) and
    Northland Community and Technical College’s [“A Closer Look at
    Water”](http://programs.northlandcollege.edu/biology/Biology1111/animations/hydrogenbonds.html)
    (Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Please click through these tutorials for a visual
    understanding of the molecular properties of water.  Think about how
    these properties affect the interactions between water and other
    types of molecules, such as lipids and other nonpolar substances.

**2.2 Macromolecules** <span id="2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: J. Kousen’s “Biochemistry - Proteins through Nucleic
    Acids” and University of New Mexico’s “Biological Macromolecules”**
    Links: J. Kousen’s [“Biochemistry - Proteins through Nucleic
    Acids”](http://www.hobart.k12.in.us/jkousen/Biology/biochem.htm) (HTML)
    and [University of New Mexico’s “Biological
    Macromolecules”](http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_124/Summaries/Macromol.html)(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read through these two pages to gain a better
    understanding of the chemical properties that differentiate
    proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.  Think about how
    these differences affect how each macromolecule will interact with
    its environment and other nearby macromolecules.  
        
     For the first reading, begin reading the text under the subtitle
    “Proteins” and continue through the section entitled “Nucleic
    Acids.”  
        
     The second reading is an in-depth explanation of the Benedict,
    Iodine, and Biuret tests, which are commonly used to test for the
    presence of lipids, starches, and proteins.  Be sure you understand
    why each “works,” i.e. how each tests for the presence of its
    particular macromolecule.

    Molecules” Lab](http://www.occc.edu/biologylabs/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the “Organic Molecules” link on this
    page to access the lab.  Click through this virtual lab to visually
    understand how Benedict, Iodine, Biuret and Sudan IV tests would be
    conducted.  Using your knowledge from the previous reading, explain
    the test results.  Then answer the following questions:  
        
     1)    What are the identifiable differences between proteins,
    lipids, and carbohydrates?  
     2)    How can these macromolecules be experimentally
    differentiated?  
     3)    When might it be necessary to experimentally differentiate
    between these macromolecules?  
        
     When you are done, check your work against the Saylor Foundation’s

    Structure”](http://www.johnkyrk.com/chromosomestructure.html) (Adobe
    Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Please click through each of these tutorials to gain
    a visual understanding of DNA and its components.  The first
    tutorial provides a quick overview and the second tutorial presents
    you with the chance to create your own DNA strand based upon your
    understanding of the matching base pairs in DNA.  The last tutorial
    is about the structure of chromosomes, which are made up of DNA as
    it is coiled or folded.  As you go through these materials, think
    about the importance of the chemical and physical structure of each
    component.
