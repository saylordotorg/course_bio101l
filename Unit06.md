**Unit 6: Cellular Metabolism** <span id="6"></span> 
*Cellular metabolism consists of glycolysis and cellular respiration. 
Our activities in this unit will focus on understanding the process of
cellular respiration, what is required for it to occur, and how it can
be altered.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 2 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the processes of cellular metabolism.
-   List the steps of glycolysis and cellular respiration.
-   Determine the factors that would influence or alter various specific
    steps of glycolysis and respiration.

     Instructions:  Please read this page to refresh your memory
    regarding the cellular respiration process, which you learned about
    in the lecture portion of this course.  Pay special attention to the
    reactants and products of each reaction that occurs during
    respiration.  Practice writing out the entire process of respiration
    on your own, without looking at your notes.

     Instructions: Please click through this tutorial to visually
    familiarize yourself with the process of cellular respiration.  As
    you work through this material, think about how each step in the
    process relies upon the last, and what role environmental factors
    play in the process.  Then answer the following questions:  
        
     1)    How could you experimentally alter cellular respiration?  
     2)    Why might it be beneficial in some situations to do so?
