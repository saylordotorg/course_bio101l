**Unit 8: Cell Division** <span id="8"></span> 
*There are two types of cell division: mitosis, and meiosis.  In this
unit, we will study both types, and discover what makes them different
from each other.  An understanding of the cell cycle and how division
fits into it is emphasized.  The unit begins with a lesson on how to
create a “karyotype” (essentially, a photograph of a cell’s
chromosomes).  It is important to visually understand the chromosomal
content of a cell here, since chromosomal replication and division is an
integral part of the cell division process.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Distinguish between mitosis and meiosis and discuss the significance
    of each.
-   List the steps of mitosis and meiosis and identify which step of the
    process a cell is engaged in.
-   Design experiments involving your knowledge of what occurs within a
    cell during different stages of the cell cycle.

     Instructions: Before studying the process of cell division, click
    through this tutorial to learn about what a full “set” of
    chromosomes is, and how scientists can extract and document a full
    set of chromosomes from a subject for study.  Think about how
    creating a subject’s karyotype would be useful in a medical or other
    scientific study.

     Instructions: Please click through the two tutorials linked above
    to gain a visual understanding of the process of mitosis.  Be sure
    that you can remember all of the steps of the process and identify
    the stage of mitosis by the appearance of the virtual cell.  Then
    move on to the mitosis lab, where you will see pictures of actual
    cells undergoing mitosis.

    gain a visual understanding of the process of meiosis.  Be sure that
    you can remember all of the steps in the process and identify the
    stage of meiosis by the appearance of the virtual cell.  Then move
    on to the mitosis lab, where you will see pictures of actual cells
    undergoing mitosis, and practice your understanding.

     Instructions: Please click through this tutorial to gain a visual
    understanding of the differences between meiosis and mitosis.  The
    steps of each process will occur concurrently on the screen,
    allowing you to note the differences.  Then, answer the following
    questions:  
        
     1)    How could you use your knowledge of cell division to
    understand how best to experimentally inhibit or promote cell
    growth?  
     2)    When might doing this be practically useful?
